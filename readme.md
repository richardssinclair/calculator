## Calculator

I chose to use plain Vanilla JavaScript just to go back to the basics.

I found this task quite challenging. I really struggled with the javascript section of the project but it is an aspect I really enjoy learning about. Trying to solve or tackle problems is something I really want to improve on and I think with more time and more practice I will get there.

I did quite a bit of research, watched a few tutorials and looked through documentation and walk though examples to get to this result.

I used flex to style the calculator, I thought it would be the best way to order and display things.
